# 🚀 PPT.fy — AI-Powered Presentation Generator

**PPT.fy** is an AI-powered presentation maker that lets users create modern, professional PPTs in just one click. By simply providing a topic and the desired number of slides, the platform uses NLP to generate structured content, relevant images, animated flowcharts (via Manim), graphs, and LaTeX equations. Users can customize fonts, colors, and more, and save or download their presentations for later use.
